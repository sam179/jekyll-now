This is the first time I am writing about a film that I liked. I hope I would be able to write more stuff like this. Blue is the Warmest Color is my first ode into french cinema and dare I say, it absolutely won't be my last. BITWC is a 2013 film about a high school girl trying to find her sexual identity.
