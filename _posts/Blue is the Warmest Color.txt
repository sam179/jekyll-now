This is the first time I am writing about a film that I liked. I hope I would be able to write more stuff like this. Blue is the Warmest Color is my first ode into french cinema and dare I say, it absolutely won't be my last. BITWC is a 2013 film about a high school girl trying to find her sexual identity. Adele played by the actor of the same name Adèle Exarchopoulos, starts off as high school literature student and soon realizes her attraction towards women. She soon develops a passionate relationship with a much older and charismatic Emma, played by Léa Seydoux. Art and sexuality are the most predominant themes of this film. There are glimpses of reflection of society's view on lesbian relationships. Even then, this film does not really try to be a take on society's views or about being a lesbian in a conservative French city. This is more simply a love story between Adele and Emma, and in that it is endearing. Adèle Exarchopoulos who is 25 now, would have been 20 when this film was shot, and boy oh boy, she gives one of the best female performances I have seen. Character Adele is an introvert and conflicted about herself
