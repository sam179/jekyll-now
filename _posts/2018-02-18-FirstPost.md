title: my first post: A Roadmap  (Yay?)
---

I find myself in a precarious situation. I have accumulated lots of material, along with creating a list of concepts to be
learned. Time I get after work has been limited, so I would have to plan and pick and complete certain things in an orderly
manner, if there is to be any chance of accomplishing all this stuff in a few months, then a little more proactivity would be required.

Sorting the materials and creating a roadmap would be the first goal. Since now I have planned to do both, apply for an intern and find a job, there are certain things that must go out of the way very soon. First area of business would be to draft letters for each shortlisted professors. Heck first I need to trim that list.
And if the application drafts are any indication, even one letter takes shitload of time to perfect.

Secondly a learning structure. So my goal is to master a lot of Data Science and Machine Learning concepts, at the same time improving my programming efficiency. Due to some unknown reason, this time I am motivated to start from absolute basics. It is understood that the language for work is Python, even though I know the language, I am including a Python book in the reading check list. Library which I have decided to learn is Tensorflow. This has proven to be extremely tricky to navigate in the past, so I am going to dedicate some time in understanding it. I have also bought a Udemy course that would assist me in relearning the said ML concepts and putting them to code. Then there is a matter of the fast.ai lectures. Before that I would like to complete the complete the The Deep Learning book. This book is going to take the majority of time in completion. Further there are the Stanford courses for NLP and Computer Vision, which are not an immediate concern, as my plan is not to take them until much later.
