title: The Goldman Sachs Interview Experience
---

After a number of attempts to score this interview, I finally got the Goldman Sachs call when I was probably not even expecting to get one. So a couple of days before the New Year, I got a call from their HCM office that they have an opening and would like to try me. At that point I was all but done with the applications process, so I thought why the heck not. I was planning to restart my interview prep after applications anyways. The call just pushed the schedule forward.

I was first asked to give a code-pair round. Now rounds like these are held on screen sharing platforms. Only this time, platform also had a complier, so I had to run the code for cases as well. Two questions were to be solved in one hour. Now it could have been tricky to completely run two questions in an hour. However, questions turned out to be pretty easy. I wrote code in great time and as able to test them on interviewer's behest.


I was very sure of this next round. Then the call came, and I suddenly realised that I only had like a week for the preparation of this and I was actually at home driving around with Mom. Came back to my apartment and prepared as best as I could. Now unlike the previous code pair round where there were brief greetings and then problem solving, this was a complete interview with substanial dialogue and a wide variety of questions and discussions. I hadn't given those in months. Also, unlike other organisations, a GS panel has more than one interviewer. This, I think is actually very good for interviewee as it adds more perspective to the interview. This round was a balanced one. After customary introduction, I was asked about OOPS. Now I prepped for this and was able to give a fairly general introduction. This was followed by a system design question on which I fumbled quite a bit, but was still able to put up some points. I kicked myself later for this, as this was a fairly principled based question. Then I got a puzzle, which I solved. Then finally an algorithmic question. It took some time to get the trick. Was honestly nervous for a moment. Made it in okayish complexity. Got another puzzle, made it though there was some communication gap at the end, it was clear I had solved it. After a week, I hit up the HR asking the result. She confirmed that I had cleared up the round and that she would confirm the date and stuff for further process. Pure Elation. I had never been called up for onsite interviews. I was being now.


So cutting all the crap of booking tickets and taking flights and everything, now I am in Bangalore.
