After all the hype I heard about Norwegian Wood, this finally felt like a time I could pick it up. The language has been pretty basic, I guess that is the case when a non-English speaking author writes an English novel. I guess if there is something consistent in Murakami's work, it's his generous use of metaphors. Norwegian Wood feels a bit more forthright than Kafka on the Shore, but it ain't an exception to the metaphor rule.


First, Watanabe sitting in flight listening to Norwegian Wood and reminiscing the weird meadow experience with Naoko. I am beginning to think the overall beautiful scenery around them reminded him of their beautiful relationship and the deep dark well with no bottom was perhaps the miniature closet of darkness that engulfed them due to Kizuki's death. In another instance of a much smaller scale, we Toru suffering as Naoko leaves Tokyo. He feels great apathy towards his life. He recovers with time and this is shown beautifully with the "Firefly in the jar"  metaphor.
