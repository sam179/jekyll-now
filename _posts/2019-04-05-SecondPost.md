title: The Goldman Sachs Interview Experience
---


After a number of attempts to score this interview, I finally got the Goldman Sachs call when I was probably not even expecting to get one. So a couple of days before the New Year, I got a call from their HCM office that they have an opening and would like to try me. At that point, I was all but done with the applications process, so I thought why the heck not. I was planning to restart my interview prep after applications anyways. The call just pushed the schedule forward.

I was first asked to give a code-pair round. Now rounds like these are held on screen sharing platforms. Only this time, the platform also had a compiler, so I had to run the code for cases as well. Two questions were to be solved in one hour. Now it could have been tricky to completely run two questions in an hour. However, questions turned out to be pretty easy. I wrote code in a great time and as able to test them on interviewer's behest.


I was very sure of this next round. Then the call came, and I suddenly realized that I only had like a week for the preparation of this and I was actually at home driving around with Mom. Came back to my apartment and prepared as best as I could. Now unlike the previous code pair round where there were brief greetings and then problem-solving, this was a complete interview with substantial dialogue and a wide variety of questions and discussions. I hadn't given those in months. Also, unlike other organizations, a GS panel has more than one interviewer. This, I think is actually very good for interviewee as it adds more perspective to the interview. This round was a balanced one. After a customary introduction, I was asked about OOPS. Now I prepped for this and was able to give a fairly general introduction. This was followed by a system design question on which I fumbled quite a bit but was still able to put up some points. I kicked myself later for this, as this was a fairly principled based question. Then I got a puzzle, which I solved. Then finally an algorithmic question. It took some time to get the trick. Was honestly nervous for a moment. Made it in okayish complexity. Got another puzzle, made it though there was some communication gap at the end, it was clear I had solved it. After a week, I hit up the HR asking the result. She confirmed that I had cleared up the round and that she would confirm the date and stuff for further process. Pure Elation. I had never been called up for onsite interviews. I was being now.


So cutting all the crap of booking tickets and taking flights and everything, now I am in Bangalore. The strange industrial air of Bangalore. Bangalore is multicultural the way, New York and San Francisco are. Difference? Just that here people are various sub-Indian ethnicities instead of different countries. One by-product of this interview was being able to meet friends living in Bangalore. Stayed with one overnight who was also a GS employee. Then in the morning, traveled with him to his office. Funny how life works out, three of my closest friends not only worked for the very company, they also worked in the same fookin building. With the same friend, had the breakfast of probably the tastiest dosas I ever had in the common cafeteria of the Embassy Golf Links Business Park. With a filled belly, I knew it was time to go to war. Another interesting setting here was that the interview process was dictated solely by the concerned departments and not the HCM. I told them about my 9.30 evening flight. Which means knowing Bangalore traffic, I had to leave office at almost 6.30.

The interviews started at 11.00 AM. First round is probably the hardest to remember. I can't even remember the interviewers of that round. On focusing hard enough, I am able to gather an outline on the topics which were asked. So it started like every other round with a brief discussion about my current work, and projects. This round briefed on one of my described projects. Had a discussion based on that for quite some time. Then I remember being given a pretty basic algorithmic question. Was nice to warm up like that. Then another not so tough question was thrown. And then voila first round was over like that. Time for Round 2! This time two slightly more senior people(I am guessing VPs) arrived. It started the same as the previous one, with a discussion of a project at Paytm and then taking it forward to build another system. This round turned out to be a bit of a stumper. I was asked about storing a certain type of data which was obtained from a database call and how would that be transferred over different microservices. I really had no freaking clue about this. In fact, to fully get this, I was him to repeat the question several times. Finally, he gave up and moved on. He was visibly disappointed with how the things had unfolded here. The other guy took pity on me and asked me to design an LRU cache. I pretended to think and iteratively reach at a solution. I mean everyone fucking knows how to design a fucking LRU cache or what the F are you doing at the interview in the first place. This was still a net negative. I mean they had to know everyone knows how to design an LRU, right?. It seems like they were done too. Because there were 10 minutes left for the slot, they decided to go with another question. This question was pretty atypical and tricky. And I did not have more than 10 minutes to think of a solution. Great, huh. I presented an obvious O(N*M) solution. Yeah, it was a matrix question. They laughed on the inside and reminded me they expected at least an O(N+M) solution. I persisted and focussed a lot more than what I was already doing. And BAMMM!!!! after a little hint I got it. How to eliminate solutions and optimize. Heck, I optimized it even more than they expected. Finally, I gave them an O(log(N*M)) solution. All under 10 mins. This might have been an inflection point for the interview. It's not like the first interview was bad, but now at least I had something to show for this second round.



And it was 1 pm. Time for lunch. Had lunch at their office cafeteria, which was surprisingly nothing fancy at all. Ate simple food while chatting up with the same pal who I stayed with. After not much adieu, began Round 3.
