I am Samar Singh Holkar, a coder working as a Software Engineer. When I am not working, I am watching, talking, reading or writing about football. Outside of that I like exploring animes with unconventional genres. Used to be a movie buff, but now I am barely able to catch up with latest films. Also used to be an avid reader, but alas that time is also in the past. Still manage to find some time to read and currently my favourite genre is cyberpunk. I guess this is me.
